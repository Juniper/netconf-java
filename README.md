This is a breaking change to the API. New Device objects are now created using a builder.
Example:
```
Device device = Device.builder().hostName("hostname")
    .userName("username")
    .password("password")
    .hostKeysFileName("hostKeysFileName")
    .build();    
```

    public class ShowInterfaces {
        public static void main(String args[]) throws NetconfException,
                  ParserConfigurationException, SAXException, IOException {

            //Create device
            Device device = Device.builder()
                                .hostName("hostname")
                                .userName("username")

                                .build(); 
            device.connect();

            //Send RPC and receive RPC Reply as XML
            XML rpc_reply = device.executeRPC("get-interface-information");
            /* OR
             * device.executeRPC("<get-interface-information/>");
             * OR
             * device.executeRPC("<rpc><get-interface-information/></rpc>");
             */

            System.out.println(rpc_reply);
            device.close();
